    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and managing
      BGP, including protocol, policy, and operational aspects based on data
      center, carrier and content provider operational requirements.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes a <xref target="RFC7950">YANG</xref> data
      model for the <xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref> protocol, including
      various protocol extensions, policy configuration, as well as defining
      key operational state data, including Routing Information Base (RIB).
      The model is intended to be vendor-neutral, in order to allow operators
      to manage BGP configuration in heterogeneous environments with routers
      supplied by multiple vendors. The model is also intended to be readily
      mapped to existing implementations to facilitate support from as large a
      set of routing hardware and software vendors as possible.</t>

      <section anchor="goals" title="Goals and approach">
        <t>The model covers the base BGP features that are deployed across
        major implementations and the common BGP configurations in use across
        a number of operator network deployments. In particular, this model
        attempts to cover BGP features defined in <xref
        target="RFC4271">BGP</xref>, <xref target="RFC1997">BGP Communities
        Attribute </xref>, <xref target="RFC4456">BGP Route Reflection</xref>,
        <xref target="RFC4760">Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 </xref>,
        <xref target="RFC5065">Autonomous System Confederations for BGP
        </xref>, <xref target="RFC2439">BGP Route Flap Damping </xref>, <xref
        target="RFC4724">Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP </xref>, and <xref
        target="RFC6811">BGP Prefix Origin Validation </xref>.</t>

        <t>Along with configuration of base BGP features, this model also
        addresses policy configuration, by providing "hooks" for applying
        policies, and also defining BGP-specific policy features. The BGP
        policy features are intended to be used with the general routing
        policy model defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model">A
        YANG Data Model for Routing Policy Management </xref>. The model
        conforms to the <xref target="RFC8342">NMDA</xref> architecture.</t>

        <t>For the base BGP features, the focus of the model described in this
        document is on providing configuration and operational state
        information relating to: <list style="symbols">
            <t>The global BGP instance, and neighbors whose configuration is
            specified individually, or templated with the use of
            peer-groups.</t>

            <t>The address families that are supported by peers, and the
            global configuration which relates to them.</t>

            <t>The policy configuration "hooks" and BGP-specific policy
            features that relate to a neighbor - controlling the import and
            export of NLRIs.</t>

            <t>RIB contents.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>As mentioned earlier, any configuration items that are deemed to be
        widely available in existing major BGP implementations are included in
        the model. Additional, more esoteric, configuration items that are not
        commonly used, or only available from a single implementation, are
        omitted from the model with an expectation that they will be available
        in companion modules that augment or extend the current model. This
        allows clarity in identifying data that is part of the vendor-neutral
        base model.</t>

        <t>Where possible, naming in the model follows conventions used in
        available standards documents, and otherwise tries to be
        self-explanatory with sufficient descriptions of the intended
        behavior. Similarly, configuration data value constraints and default
        values, where used, are based on recommendations in current standards
        documentation, or those commonly used in multiple implementations.
        Since implementations can vary widely in this respect, this version of
        the model specifies only a limited set of defaults and ranges with the
        expectation of being more prescriptive in future versions based on
        actual operator use.</t>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Model overview">
      <t>The BGP model is defined across several YANG modules and submodules,
      but at a high level is organized into six elements:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>base protocol configuration -- configuration affecting BGP
          protocol-related operations, defined at various levels of
          hierarchy.</t>

          <t>multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting individual
          address-families within BGP <xref target="RFC4760">Multiprotocol
          Extensions for BGP-4 </xref>.</t>

          <t>neighbor configuration -- configuration affecting an individual
          neighbor within BGP.</t>

          <t>neighbor multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting
          individual address-families for a neighbor within BGP.</t>

          <t>policy configuration -- hooks for application of the policies
          defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model">A YANG Data
          Model for Routing Policy Management </xref> that act on routes sent
          (received) to (from) peers or other routing protocols and
          BGP-specific policy features.</t>

          <t>operational state -- variables used for monitoring and management
          of BGP operations.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>These modules also make use of standard Internet types, such as IP
      addresses and prefixes, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in
      <xref target="RFC6991">Common YANG Data Types </xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="overview.protocol" title="BGP protocol configuration">
        <t>The BGP protocol configuration model is organized hierarchically,
        much like the majority of router implementations. That is,
        configuration items can be specified at multiple levels, as shown
        below.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
              +--rw bgp
                 +--rw global!
                 |  +-- (global-configuration-options)
                 +--rw neighbors
                 |  +--rw neighbor* [neighbor-address]
                 |  +-- (neighbor-configuration-options)
                 +--rw peer-groups
                    +--rw peer-group* [peer-group-name]
                    +-- (neighbor-configuration-options)
            ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Users may specify configuration at a higher level and have it apply
        to all lower-level items, or provide overriding configuration at a
        lower level of the hierarchy. Overriding configuration items are
        optional, with neighbor specific configuration being the most specific
        or lowest level, followed by peer-group, and finally global. Global
        configuration options reflect a subset of the peer-group or neighbor
        specific configuration options which are relevant to the entire BGP
        instance.</t>

        <t>The model makes the simplifying assumption that most of the
        configuration items are available at all levels of the hierarchy. That
        is, very little configuration is specific to a particular level in the
        hierarchy, other than obvious items such as "group-name" only being
        available for the peer group-level config. A notable exception is for
        sub-address family configuration where some items are only applicable
        for a given AFI-SAFI combination.</t>

        <t>In order to allow common configuration to be applied to a set of
        neighbors, all neighbor configuration options are available within a
        peer-group. A neighbor is associated to a particular peer-group
        through the use of a peer-group leaf (which provides a reference to a
        configured item in the peer-group list).</t>

        <t>Address-family configuration is made available in multiple points
        within the model - primarily within the global container, where
        instance-wide configuration can be set (for example, global protocol
        parameters, the BGP best path route selection options, or global
        policies relating to the address-family); and on a per-neighbor or
        per-peer-group basis, where address-families can be enabled or
        disabled, and policy associated with the parent entity applied. Within
        the afi-safi container, generic configuration that applies to all
        address-families (e.g., whether the AFI-SAFI is enabled) is presented
        at the top-level, with address-family specific containers made
        available for options relating to only that AFI-SAFI. Within the
        current revision of the model a generic set of address-families, and
        common configuration and state options are included - further work is
        expected to add additional parameters to this area of the model.</t>

        <t>The following address-families are currently supported by the
        model:</t>

      <t>The modules comprising the BGP configuration and operational model
      are described by the YANG modules and submodules in the sections
      below.</t>

      <t>The main module, ietf-bgp.yang, includes the following submodules:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>ietf-bgp-common - defines the groupings that are common across
          more than one context (where contexts are neighbor, group,
          global)</t>

          <t>ietf-bgp-common-multiprotocol - defines the groupings that are
          common across more than one context, and relate to multiprotocol
          BGP</t>

          <t>ietf-bgp-common-structure - defines groupings that are shared by
          multiple contexts, but are used only to create structural elements,
          i.e., containers (leaf nodes are defined in separate groupings)</t>

          <t>ietf-bgp-global - groupings with data specific to the global
          context</t>

          <t>ietf-bgp-peer-group - groupings with data specific to the peer
          group context</t>

          <t>ietf-bgp-neighbor - groupings with data specific to the neighbor
          context</t>
        </list> Additional modules include: <list style="symbols">
          <t>ietf-bgp-types - common type and identity definitions for BGP,
          including BGP policy</t>

          <t>ietf-bgp-policy - BGP-specific policy data definitions for use
          with <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model"/> (described in more
          detail <xref target="overview.policy"/>)</t>
